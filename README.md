# Create a marvel Team!
We need to create marvel teams to accomplish several missions around the world.
For this we need 5 teams:
 

 1. The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes: assemble a team of heroes that appear at least one time on avengers comic
 2. The X-men: assemble a team of heroes that appear at least  one time on x-men comic
 3. Spiderman Friends: assemble a team of heroes that appear at least  one time on Spider Man comics
 4. Wolverine Friends: assemble a team of heroes that appear at least  one time on Wolverine comics or were team with him.
 5. Create your own team with any team assemble logic (explain logic)

 


# Process
This process should be repeated until all the teams are complete

 1. Choose the team (Avengers, Xmen, etc)
 2. Find the heroes that only match with the team we need on a finder that show photo, link of bio, and general info from the heroe 
 3. Select the members of the team
 4. We need to confirm the members of the team and then save it
